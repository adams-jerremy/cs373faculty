= How It Works =

The importer begins by opening the filename it is given.  Next, it reads each line and appends it to a String called xml; it stops when there are no more lines to read.  After that, BeautifulStoneSoup is called for xml and assigned to a variable called facxml.  Finally the values of the aforementioned variables are assigned the appropriate values (taken from facxml).
